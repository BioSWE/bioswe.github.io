Here are the courses I'll be working through over the next week, along with initial study hour goals. Next Sunday, I'll review my progress and make adjustments as needed. 

I want to keep the feedback loop long enough to be representative but short enough to cut/add without wasting too much time. I feel like weekly reviews on Sundays is a good place to start.

## A Note On Content

These starting courses should reflect two things: 

1. I have zero *formal* bio education. 
2. I've worked as a data engineer for a few years using Python, NoSQL, and Airflow automate data ETL pipelines.

I'm starting with MIT's "Secret of Life" since it's one of the highest recommended free intro bio courses I've found online. 

And finally, I'm using the SWE courses to a) fill gaps in foundational knowledge (especially algorithms and data structures) and b) improve my backend engineering skills so that I can implement necessary computational logic for the tools I hope to build and then deploy them.
