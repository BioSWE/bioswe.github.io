title: Curriculum - Phase 01 - Version 01

Here are the courses I'll be working through over the next week, along with initial study hour goals. Next Sunday, I'll review my progress and make adjustments as needed. 

I want to keep the feedback loop long enough to be representative but short enough to cut/add without wasting too much time. I feel like weekly reviews on Sundays is a good place to start.
