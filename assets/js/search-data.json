I left my job in March 2020 (resignation sent in late January) to travel… and then, well, a global pandemic put those plans on hold. . Now, I’m using this time to set up a future working on problems I believe to be important and impactful. . What . I’m attempting to publicly learn the skills and knowledge necessary to build software tools for the biosciences. . Starting from (almost) the beginning, many of the first SWE courses and projects will be intermediate level, while those for biology will be more foundational. . I will maintain a curriculum page, updating and refining it as I work through the material. . Why . I believe that the intersection of the biosciences and computing will bring some of the most exciting and transformative changes in my lifetime. I also believe it would be a supreme mistake to live my life and not participate. . I don’t want that regret, so this is my attempt to build an exciting, impactful life in that intersection. . You . If you share my excitement about the future, please follow along and learn with me! . Note: Everyone is welcome. This is an aggressively inclusive space. Intolerance will not be tolerated. :) .",
